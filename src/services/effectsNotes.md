# Effects
See https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects
## Definition
Effects allow the *specification of side effects* for components. This essentially allows functions to be invoked on the rendering of a component.

### Reminder: Side Effects
Side-effects are "any observable effect other than the primary effects of reading the value of arguments and returning a value."
